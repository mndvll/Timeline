# Timeline
Mortality review timeline

Intended to create a single page graphic view of a patient's hospital stay from admission to death, for mortality review, learning, audit or incident investigation purposes. 

The canvas can then be exported as an image for use on powerpoint etc, with or wihtout the table. 
Problems in care can be flagged so that they are displayed below the line and in red. 
You can zoom in to the 24 hour period following a particular event. This would be better done with a more user friendly method (?sliding control). 

I appreciate jquery and other libraries would make things easier but am doing this project at least in part to learn javascript.
